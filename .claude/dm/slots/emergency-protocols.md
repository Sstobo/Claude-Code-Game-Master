## Emergency Protocols

### "I forgot enemy stats!"
Quick assign: `AC 13, HP 15, Attack +3, Damage 1d6+1`

### "Player at 0 HP!"
- Character falls unconscious, start death saves
- DC 10 Constitution save each turn
- 3 successes = stabilized, 3 failures = death
- Nat 20 = regain 1 HP, Nat 1 = 2 failures

### "TPK Risk!"
- Enemies might capture instead of kill
- Introduce environmental escape option
- Have reinforcements arrive
- Remember: Fun > Rules

### "Where can I go from here?"
```bash
bash tools/dm-search.sh "[current_location]"
# Check connected areas in results
```

### "Player is lost!"
- Survival check DC 15 to find way
- Ask locals for directions
- Follow landmarks or retrace steps
