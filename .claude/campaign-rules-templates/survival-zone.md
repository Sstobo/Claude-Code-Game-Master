## rules

### Survival resources
Four vital stats, each from 0 to 100:
- **Hunger**: -5/day without food. At 0 — Exhaustion, -2 to all rolls. At 0 for more than a day — DC 12 CON/hour or death.
- **Thirst**: -10/day without water. More critical than hunger. At 0 — DC 14 CON/6h.
- **Radiation** (Rad): accumulates, does not clear without anti-rad/medic. At 25+ — -1 to MAX HP. At 50+ — -2 to rolls. At 75+ — Radiation Sickness (DC 15 CON every hour). At 100 — death.
- **Fatigue**: -10/6h without rest. At 0 — forced sleep, -3 to all rolls until they sleep.

**Food and water:** mutated food grants +20 Hunger but +1d6 Rad. Clean water is rare — filtration DC 12 or +1d4 Rad per 500ml consumed.

### Radiation and anomalies
**Radiation zones:**
- Weak (yellow): +1 Rad/min, DC 12 CON once per hour
- Moderate (orange): +3 Rad/min, requires protection
- Strong (red): +10 Rad/min, lethal without specialized protection within 10 minutes
- Blowout: all open areas +20 Rad/min for 1d4 hours, DC 18 or Rad +50

**Anomalies** — static or roaming traps:
- Whirligig: magnetic pull (STR DC 14 each round or pulled in), 3d6 bludgeoning damage
- Electro: 2d8 lightning on approach, DC 15 DEX or paralyzed 1 round
- Jelly: slowing (Speed /2), on submersion 2d6 acid/turn
- Burner: heat zone, 1d6 fire/turn, gear degrades twice as fast
- Detecting an anomaly: DC 13 Perception or you walk into it. Bolts/nuts allow scouting (+3 to detection DC).

### Artifacts
Artifacts form inside anomalies and grant powerful bonuses at a cost:
- **Soul**: +10 to MAX HP, but Radiation accumulates +2/hour passively
- **Blood**: regeneration 1 HP/round, Hunger -5/hour additionally
- **Flash**: +3 to stealth and speed, Fatigue -15/6h additionally
- **Medusa**: immunity to poison, Thirst -15/6h additionally
- **Stone Flower**: Armor +2, Speed -3 meters

Carrying without a container: +2 Rad/hour per artifact. Container (rare): neutralizes passive effect.
Searching: only within anomalies, DC 16 Perception + Rad mask or +1d10 Rad per attempt.

### Gear degradation
Every piece of equipment has a **Condition** from 100% to 0%.
- Weapons: -5% per combat, -10% on Nat 1, -1% per day without maintenance
- Armor: -3% per combat (if damage was received), -5% on a critical hit
- At Condition 50%: -1 to attack rolls/AC
- At Condition 25%: -2 to rolls, DC 12 each round or jam (weapons)
- At Condition 0%: broken, non-functional

**Repair:** requires parts (found/bought) + DC 12 Repair. Each attempt restores +10-30% Condition. Without parts — DC 16 improvisation, maximum 50%.

### Factions and reputation
Reputation with each faction: from -100 (war) to +100 (ally).
- **Neutral** (-20 to +20): standard prices, no assistance
- **Friend** (+21 to +50): -15% prices, occasional information
- **Ally** (+51 to +100): shelter, quests, unique loot, assistance in combat
- **Enemy** (-21 to -50): attack on sight, -20% prices with others if they find out
- **War** (-51 to -100): kill-on-sight, bounty hunters, -500 caps bounty

Reputation changes through quests (+5 to +20), betrayal (-20 to -50), killing a faction member (-10 to -30).
Factions share information — high reputation with one side's enemy reduces it with the other (DC 14 or -10 with opponents).

### Trade and zone economy
Currency: caps/sausages/5.45 rounds (setting-dependent). Scarcity is real.
- Trader: appears once every 1d4 days in a safe zone
- Black market: DC 13 Streetwise to find, prices +30% but restricted items available
- Looting: bodies yield 1d6 items (loot table by Perception DC)
- Crafting: DC 10-18 depending on item, requires components

### Anomalous events (d20 per day)
- 1: Blowout — take cover immediately, DC 14 Perception or +50 Rad
- 2-3: Bloodsucker/invisible monster — Perception DC 16 or surprise attack
- 4-5: Bandit gang — negotiate or fight
- 6-8: Anomalous storm — visibility 5m, all Perception -4
- 9-12: Quiet (but that's a bad sign)
- 13-15: Hidden stash found — d4 items, Safe Rest
- 16-18: Artifact pulse — nearest anomaly ejected an artifact
- 19: Neutral stalker — zone information, possible alliance
- 20: Lucky day — double loot from nearest bodies/caches
