## rules

### Sanity
Sanity: 0 to 100. Starting value = Wisdom × 5.
**Triggers (what reduces Sanity):**
- Victim of inhuman violence (corpse): -1d3
- Supernatural creature (first sighting): -1d6 (Perception DC 14 or -2d6)
- Death of an ally: -1d4
- Failed critical roll at a critical moment: -1
- Reading forbidden texts: -1d4 per hour of reading (but +1d6 to Mythos Knowledge)
- Direct contact with a mythos entity: -2d10

**Sanity loss thresholds:**
- 80-100: Normal
- 60-79: Anxiety. First horror roll in a scene has DC -2.
- 40-59: Neurosis. One random phobia (DC 15 Composure or panic when triggered).
- 20-39: Dissociation. -2 to all social rolls. Nightmares every night: Rest does not fully restore HP (only 50%).
- 1-19: On the edge. DC 16 Composure at the start of each stressful scene or temporary breakdown.
- 0: Madness. Character becomes an NPC until treated. Or permanent mania.

**Sanity recovery:** therapy (DC 14 Medicine × 3 sessions = +1d6), successfully closing a case (+1d8), meaningful social bonds (+1d4/week), religious ritual (Faith DC 12 = +1d4).

### Stress (separate from Sanity)
Stress: 0-10. Accumulates during a session, resets on full rest.
- +1: failed important roll, unexpected threat, bad news
- +2: witnessing violence, threat to life
- +3: losing control of the situation, being captured

At Stress 7+: all Sanity checks have DC +2.
At Stress 10: immediate Sanity check DC 16; on failure — panic breakdown (flee or aggression, DM chooses).

### Breakdown mechanics
On failed Sanity check or Stress 10 — roll on the breakdown table (d10):
1. **Catalepsy** — frozen for 1d4 rounds, cannot act
2. **Panic** — flee from the source of horror, speed ×2, for minimum 6 rounds
3. **Aggression** — attack the nearest creature (d2: ally or enemy)
4. **Dissociation** — actions take ×2 time, DM narrates in third person
5. **Mania** — obsessive compulsion (DM sets), must carry out for ×3 rounds
6. **Mutism** — cannot speak for 1d6×10 minutes
7. **Hallucination** — sees/hears things that are not there (DM describes secretly)
8. **Amnesia** — does not remember the last 1d6 hours (DM erases)
9. **Hysteria** — laughs or cries uncontrollably, cannot conceal condition, -4 to Stealth
10. **Stupor** — sits staring at one point for 1d4 hours. Any threat = +1d6 Stress

### Clues and investigation
Every investigation uses a **Clue Track**: 0/5/10/15/20 clues to resolution.
- Basic scene examination: DC 12 Perception → 1-2 clues
- Witness interrogation: DC 13 Persuasion/Intimidation → 1 clue + 1 connection
- Archives/library: DC 14 Research → 2-3 clues, takes 2-4 hours
- Hidden location: DC 15 Investigation → d3 clues, +1d3 Stress
- Every 5 clues: DM reveals a new layer of the picture

**False clues:** on Nat 1 on any search roll — a false clue that leads astray.

### Mythos Knowledge
Mythos_Knowledge: 0-100. The higher it goes, the more you understand. And the worse things get.
- Every 10 points: Sanity MAX -5 (permanent)
- At 30+: can read forbidden texts without the penalty d4 to Sanity
- At 50+: automatically recognize a mythos entity (no Perception DC required)
- At 70+: can perform mythos rituals (cost: Sanity -2d6 per ritual)
- At 90+: the character knows too much. DC 18 Sanity every week or degradation.

**Gaining Mythos_Knowledge:** reading texts (+1d6/hour), direct contact with an entity (+1d4), successful Arcane DC 15 (+1), mythos ritual (+2d4).

### Forbidden knowledge
Texts have a **Corruption Rating** (1-5). Reading:
- takes CR × 2 hours
- grants CR × d4 Mythos_Knowledge
- deals CR × d3 Sanity damage
- reveals facts about a specific threat (DM decides)

Text examples:
- Newspaper clipping (CR 1): quick, minimal knowledge
- Cultist's personal diary (CR 2): ritual details, names
- Academic monograph (CR 3): systematic knowledge
- Mythos grimoire (CR 4): rituals, summonings
- Primary source in entity language (CR 5): catastrophically dangerous

### Confronting threats
Mythos entities **cannot be killed with conventional weapons** — only driven off or sealed.
- Physical combat: damage is dealt, but the entity regenerates 1d6/turn
- Vulnerabilities: each entity has its own (fire, silver, specific ritual) — DC 16 Mythos Knowledge to know them
- Banishment/sealing: requires a ritual (find the formula, ingredients, location), DC 14-20 depending on the entity
- Attempting negotiation: DC 18 Composure + Mythos Knowledge / 10; on failure — it attacks immediately

### Team dynamics
- Group trust: shared value 0-100. Below 40 — Stress bonus, orders require DC 13 Persuasion.
- Secrets: each character has a secret (DM sets). Revealing a secret: -1d6 to group trust, +1d4 Stress.
- When a team member dies: Sanity -1d6 for everyone, Trust -10.
