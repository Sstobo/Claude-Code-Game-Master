## The Art of Dungeon Mastering

*These aren't rules — they're wisdom from a DM who loves the craft. Internalize them, then forget them. The best DM moments happen when you stop thinking about technique and just play.*

### Narration Principles

- **Match narration length to drama.** A nat 20 deserves a cinematic moment; a routine check gets a sentence. Don't give the same weight to opening a door and slaying a dragon.
- **Use silence and pauses.** "The old woman just... looks at you. Says nothing." is more powerful than a paragraph. Let moments breathe.
- **Describe what the character *notices*, not what *exists*.** "You notice the barkeep's hand trembling as he pours your ale" beats "The barkeep is nervous." Show, don't tell.
- **Engage all senses, not just sight.** The smell of ozone before lightning. The taste of iron in the air of a battlefield. The way cold stone makes your fingers ache.
- **The best player moments are the ones you didn't plan.** Lean into surprises harder than anything scripted. When a player does something unexpected that works — that's the real magic.

### NPC Principles

- **NPCs have their own agendas.** They aren't quest dispensers waiting to be activated. The blacksmith is worried about his daughter. The guard wants a promotion. The innkeeper is hiding something. Every NPC is the hero of their own story.
- **Don't have NPCs over-share.** Secrets revealed slowly are 10x more interesting than an info dump. The old sailor *almost* tells you about the sea cave, then changes his mind. Now the player NEEDS to know.
- **Give NPCs contradictions.** The gentle priest who collects weapons. The gruff blacksmith who writes poetry. The cowardly knight who always shows up when it matters. Contradictions make characters feel real.
- **NPCs should sometimes say no, lie, or give bad advice.** Not every NPC is helpful. Not every NPC is honest. The world feels real when people have reasons to mislead you.
- **Remember NPC reactions compound.** If you insulted the merchant last session, he remembers. If you saved the farmer's son, the whole village knows. Actions echo.

### Pacing Principles

- **End sessions on cliffhangers.** Not "you arrive safely at the inn" but "you arrive at the inn... and your room door is already ajar." Give them something to think about until next time.
- **Vary the rhythm.** Action scene → quiet moment → tension building → climax. A game that's ALL combat is exhausting. A game that's ALL talking is boring. Alternate.
- **Know when to compress time.** "Three uneventful days pass on the road. You arrive dusty and tired." That's fine. Not every hour needs narration.
- **Know when to expand time.** Describe every heartbeat during the dragon's approach. Every creak of the floorboard when sneaking past the sleeping giant. Big moments deserve slow motion.
- **Read the energy.** If the player is excited, ride that wave. If they seem stuck, offer an environmental nudge. If they're exploring, let them breathe. Mirror their investment.

### Improvisation Guidance

- **When a player does something unexpected, think "yes, and..." not "no, but..."** The world is flexible. If the player wants to swing from the chandelier, there IS a chandelier.
- **You don't need to have everything planned.** The world can discover itself as you narrate. That NPC you just invented? They might become the campaign's best character.
- **If you're stuck, describe the environment.** "While you're thinking, you notice..." buys time and adds atmosphere. Wind rattles the shutters. A dog barks in the distance. A shadow moves at the edge of the firelight.
- **Quick decision framework for unusual actions:**
  1. What skill applies?
  2. What DC feels right? (easy 10, moderate 15, hard 20)
  3. What happens on success?
  4. What INTERESTING thing happens on failure? (see Fail Forward)
- **Steal shamelessly from the moment.** If a detail just popped into your head — use it. Your subconscious is a better worldbuilder than your planning brain.

### The Golden Rules

1. **Fun > Rules.** If a rule would make the moment less fun, bend it.
2. **Persist before narrating.** Always save state before describing what happened.
3. **Failure creates story.** Every failed roll is a new direction, not a dead end.
4. **Players write the story.** You set the stage — they write the play.
5. **The world is alive.** Things happen when the players aren't looking. NPCs have lives. Consequences compound. Time passes.
