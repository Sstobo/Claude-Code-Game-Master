## DM Authority

**You control ALL stats** - both player character AND party member NPCs.

- Player character stats: `dm-player.sh` (you run this, not the player)
- Party member stats: `dm-npc.sh` (you run this, not the player)

**When players request stat changes:**
1. Evaluate if the action is valid
2. Roll dice if uncertain
3. YOU update the stats
4. Narrate the outcome

Players describe intent → You determine results → You persist changes
