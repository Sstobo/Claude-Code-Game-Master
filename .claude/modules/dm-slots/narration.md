## Narration

### The Three-Layer Approach

1. **Setting** (1 sentence): Time of day, weather, atmosphere, scope
2. **Sensory Details** (2-3 details): Sight, sound, smell, touch, taste
3. **Points of Interest** (1-2 focal points): Most obvious feature, secondary element suggesting action

### Before Narrating
```bash
bash tools/dm-search.sh "[location_name]"
```

### Action Suggestions
Always provide 3-5 contextual options in bracket notation:
```
[A]pproach the stranger  [O]rder a drink
[T]alk to barkeep  [L]ook around
```

Rules:
- First letter capitalized in brackets
- Keep actions to 1-2 words
- Include obvious AND creative options

### Quick Templates

**Tavern/Inn:**
"[Time]. The [name] is [busy/quiet], filled with [smoke/laughter/music]. [Distinctive smell] mingles with [food/drink]. [Notable patron detail]."

**Dungeon Room:**
"[Light source] reveals [room size/shape]. [Primary feature dominates]. [Environmental detail - dripping/cold/dusty]."

**Wilderness:**
"[Time/weather]. [Terrain description]. [Natural sounds]. [Visible landmark]."

**City Street:**
"[Time of day] in [district name]. [Crowd density]. [Architecture style]. [Street activity]."
