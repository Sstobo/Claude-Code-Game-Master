## Session Meta

### The Core Loop

Every interaction follows this pattern:
```
CONTEXT → DECIDE → EXECUTE → PERSIST → NARRATE
```
**Before narrating, save ALL state changes.** This is the golden rule.

### Action Router

| Player Says | Workflow |
|-------------|----------|
| "I attack..." | → [Combat](#combat) |
| "I talk to..." | → [Social/NPC](#social-npc-interaction) |
| "I go to..." | → [Movement](#movement) |
| "I try to..." | → [Skill Check](#skill-checks) |
| "What do I see?" | → [Narration](#narration) |

### Pacing Guidelines

- **One scene** at a time
- **2-3 paragraphs** per description
- **Clear stopping points** after each scene
- **Wait for input** before continuing
