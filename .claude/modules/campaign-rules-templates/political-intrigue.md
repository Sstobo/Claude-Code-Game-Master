## rules

### Influence
The primary currency of the world. Influence: 0-100 per faction.
**Sources of influence:**
- Public victory/success: +5-15 (depends on audience)
- Rendering a service to a lord/faction: +3-10
- Eliminating a faction's enemy: +5-10
- Marriage/alliance with an influential family: +10-20
- Holding key information: +5 per each Tier-2+ secret

**Spending influence:**
- Requesting a favor: -5 to -20 (proportional to the ask)
- Summoning allies: -10 per each significant NPC
- Blocking a council decision: -15 + Influence DC 14 vs opponent
- Publicly defending the accused: -5 (if the accusation is true) or -10 (if false, but DC 16 Deception)

At Influence 0 in a faction: expulsion/persona non grata.
At Influence 80+: leadership is genuinely attainable.

### Allies and debts
Every significant NPC ally has:
- **Loyalty** (0-100): willingness to help without additional payment
- **Debt** (positive/negative): they owe you, or you owe them

**Debt mechanics:**
- Rendering a service without asking for payment: Debt +1d4 (they owe you)
- Asking for help without reciprocation: Debt -1d4 (you owe them)
- Saving a life: Debt +10 (they are obligated to you), one-time
- Betraying trust: Debt -20, Loyalty -30

**Calling in an ally:**
- At Debt > 0 (they owe you): automatic if within their power to help
- At Debt = 0 (neutral): DC 12 Persuasion + Loyalty/20
- At Debt < 0 (you owe them): DC 16 Persuasion or they refuse and Loyalty -5
- At Loyalty < 20: chance of betrayal (DM rolls d20 secretly on each summon, 1-3 = betrayal)

### Secrets as currency
Secrets are inventory items. Tiers:
- **Tier 1** (Gossip): minor fact, worth 10 Coin or a small favor
- **Tier 2** (Leverage): undermines reputation, worth 50 Coin, Influence +3 or a lord's favor
- **Tier 3** (Dark secret): destroys a career/family, worth 200 Coin or a major favor (-20 Influence if exposed)
- **Tier 4** (State secret): shifts the balance of power, priceless — only power in exchange

**Using secrets:**
- Blackmail: target makes DC 16 Composure or complies. On success — they know you know. Loyalty -15.
- Leaking through third parties: Deception DC 13 to conceal the source
- Selling: receive Tier × 50 Coin or equivalent service
- Exposing publicly: target's Influence -2d10, revealer's Influence +1d6 (or -1d6 if target is popular)

**Gathering secrets:**
- Surveillance: DC 14 Stealth + Investigation → Tier 1-2 per night
- Bribing servants: 20-50 Coin, DC 13 Persuasion → Tier 1-2
- Interrogation: DC 15 Intimidation, reveals Tier up to 3 but leaves a trail
- Magic/paranormal: DC 16 Arcana → any Tier, but dangerous

### Reputation in factions
Each character has a Reputation profile: Honor / Cunning / Cruelty / Generosity (each 0-100).
- High Honor (70+): NPCs are more willing to take your word, Persuasion +2
- High Cunning (70+): Deception DC -2, enemies are wary of direct attacks
- High Cruelty (70+): Intimidation +4, allies with low Loyalty -10 (they fear you)
- High Generosity (70+): Loyalty +10 for all allies, recruitment DC -3

**Reputation changes publicly:**
- Noble act in public: Honor +5, Generosity +3
- Public betrayal: Honor -15, Cunning +5
- Harsh punishment with witnesses: Cruelty +10
- Generous feast/gift: Generosity +8, Loyalty of all present +5

### Intrigues and conspiracies
A **conspiracy** is a multi-step operation:
1. **Reconnaissance** (DC 13 Investigation): learn the target's schedule, allies, vulnerabilities
2. **Recruitment** (DC 12-16 Persuasion): find agents, use Debt / Coin
3. **Preparation** (DC 11-15): gather resources, establish an alibi
4. **Execution** (final roll): DC depends on plan complexity
5. **Cover-up** (DC 14 Deception): erase the trail, silence witnesses

Each step on failure: +1 to next step's DC and risk of exposure (d6: 1-2 = enemies found out).

**Counter-conspiracy:**
- With Insight DC 14 at the right moment — the character senses something is wrong
- Investigation DC 16 vs the conspirator's Deception roll — detect surveillance
- Warning the target: target's Influence +5, Debt +5 from the target

### Political events (d20 per season)
- 1: Scandal — an ally is caught, Loyalty -10 for everyone, Influence -5
- 2-3: Assassination attempt — on a character or important NPC, Perception DC 15 or DC 18
- 4-5: Election/appointment — chance to take a position (Influence DC opponent+5)
- 6-8: Rumors about a character — good or bad (d2), Reputation ±1d6
- 9-12: Business as usual (quiet, but not for long)
- 13-15: New player — an influential NPC arrives, neutral toward the players
- 16-17: Two factions form an alliance — power balance shifts, -5 Influence for outsiders
- 18-19: Secret revealed — a random Tier 1-2 secret surfaces on its own
- 20: Crisis — a catastrophic event creates a power vacuum. The first to act gains +20 Influence.

### The Masquerade and public identity
**Public persona** vs **Real persona** — maintain two sheets:
- Public: what the world knows
- Real: what you and the DM know

The gap between them is a vulnerability. The greater the gap, the higher the Deception DC to maintain the mask.
- Gap 1-20: DC 12 Composure once per day
- Gap 21-50: DC 14 Composure once per day, -1 to social rolls without the mask
- Gap 51+: DC 17 Composure. On failure — the true self slips out in conversation
